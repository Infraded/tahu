## Description

This module provides features for:

* Eval of Puppet Language source text
* Stacktrace information
* Serialization and Deserialization
* Type reflection
* Data type parsing

### Eval

The `tahu::eval` function allows you to evaluate Puppet Language source strings.
Primarily intended to make it easier to use `Deferred` function evaluation as the `Deferred` data type does not support further
processing of a value produced by deferred evaluation of a function and it also does not support lambdas.

For the security conscious, `tahu::eval` is no worse than EPP but it can return any value where EPP can only return a string.
(In constrast ERB is much worse as it allows full access to the Ruby runtime).

### Stacktrace

The functions `tahu::where` and `tahu::stacktrace` provides information how the logic ended up at a particular file and line.
This is useful for custom error messages in functions, or for debugging purposes - answering "how did it end up calling this function?".

### Type Reflection

Several functions allow getting more details about data types (an Integer data type for example has the attributes `to` and `from`)
and there are functions to get such values. There are also functions to get detailed information how functions can be called, how
objects and resource types can b created - what parameters they take and what their data types are.

This is useful in several cases - for example when reading information from a file that is then used in a call, or to create
resources and you want to provide better error messages than just getting a crash when attempting to make the call/create the resource
with the data that was given. Now you can check if the data is acceptable before making the call as this gives you an opportunity
to provide a better error message.

Other use cases could be to filter out parameters given in data when they are not compatible with a particular version of
a resource or object.

### Serialization and Deserialization

Puppet can read/write `RichData` values with a `Data` compatible encoding. This is used by Puppet when a Catalog is sent from
a master to an agent. Now you can do the same type of serializtion/deserialization. For example to read/write rich data from
YAML files.

### Data type parsing

The function `tahu::to_type` transforms a string into a data type. For example `tahu::to_type("Integer[1,10]")` would parse the string
and return the actual type.

## Usage

This modules contains advancd functions. Simply call them...

## Limitations

This module requires Puppet 6.1.0 for several of the functions.

## Development

Pull requests are accepted. Issues are tracked at github. This module was developed with PDK and documentation is generated with
Puppet Strings.
